 <h1>Hannah's Favourite Movies</h1>
 <h2>My top favourite movies of all time!</h2>
 
 <hr>

 <h3>La La Land</h3>
 <p>This is one of my favourite movies, with fantastic music and the plot of an emotional rollercoaster!</p>

 <h3>Toy Story</h3>
 <p>Taking my right back to my childhood, my favourite movie growing up was Toy Story. I love them all!</p>

 <h3>Back to the Future</h3>
 <p>Not only do I know most of it word for word, but Marty McFly inspired the name of my favourite band.</p>

 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>It's too hard for me to choose a favourite - between The Chamber of Secrets, The Order of the Phoenix or The Goblet of Fire.</p>
