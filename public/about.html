<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently working as a Business Analyst for a governmental department after completing a BCS Level 4 Apprenticeship in Business Analysis with a Merit. Previously, I have worked as a primary school teacher after gaining a First Class Honours in Primary Education with Qualified Teacher Status. It was whilst working as Lead of Computing and E-Safety that I realised that I wanted to follow my aspirations in the technology field that I had when I was younger. </p>

<p>As a child growing up in the cusp of the technology boom, I remember owning my first computer aged 4. I was lucky enough that my Mum came into a small amount of money and decided to buy the (rather large!) desktop PC for me to play educational games on. From then on, I was hooked! At primary school, I used to attend the lunchtime computer club and by the age of 10, I started to create my own website using a website builder for kids called MatMice. I remember seeing other websites and learning that I could 'inspect' their code by right clicking - I felt like I was being a sneaky spy! I used to 'steal' some of their code, delete it and see what it did on my website and use it to change the background, the cursor and the scroll bar.</p>

<p>As a teenager, I used to create my own profiles on social media sites like MySpace and create my own graphics using PhotoShop. As I grew older, I threw myself into my studies to become a primary school teacher, inspired by my relatives who also worked in schools. It was only when I became a Computing Leader that I realised that I looked back at my childhood and wondered, 'what if I followed that path?' I felt that I was encouraging children with computing skills to excell whilst realising that nobody at school did that for me.</p>

<p>I decided to jump into technology through an apprenticeship as a Business Analyst, which I completed in May 2022. However, I still find myself drawn and fascinated by coding and development and therefore I am, once again, jumping back into the world of web development and seeing where it takes me.</p>
